libft
This project is a customized collection of commonly used functions in the C programming language, completed as a part of 42 Network's curriculum. 
It includes similar functions to standard library functions that can be used in any C project, but also provides custom functions and data structures.

The library contains a comprehensive testing framework to validate and test the functions, 
and detailed documentation is provided on how to use each function.

The purpose of this project is to teach students how to write functions in C and to provide a deeper understanding of how library functions can be used. 
This library will provide a strong foundation for students to use in larger C projects.

The contents of the project can be summarized as follows:

Standard library functions
Functions related to arrays
Character functions
Memory functions
List functions
Functions related to pointers
Other custom functions
Comprehensive documentation is provided for each function, including detailed descriptions, examples, and return values.

The goal of this project is to create a useful resource for anyone looking to understand the fundamentals of the C programming language. 
Any feedback or contributions are greatly appreciated.
